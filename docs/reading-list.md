## Infix Notation

Infix notation is a common format used to express arithmetic expressions.  

Pros:

- Widely supported
- Simple expressiona are easy to read and write

Cons:

- Lacks a standard
- Without parentheses it be vague and hard to read

## Postfix Notation

Postfix is a notation that precisely describes arithmetic expressions.  While it lacks the ambiguity
of infix, it can be harder to read and write.

## Unary Operators

There are places in the engine where unary operators require special handling.  These resources
helped me to implement support.
